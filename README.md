## WIL: Creating Forks 

I learned how to connect my fork with both the original repo (the upstream) and my remote copy of the repo (the fork). I also learned how to verify if I sucessfully added the remote by using the command ``` git remote -v ```

Fortunately, the instructions were clear enough so there were not major issues. 

## WIL: Creating Issues 

I learned how to add issues to a repository, and I learned that multiple people can create issues at the same time.
