## What I learned 

I learned how to connect my fork with both the original repo (the upstream) and my remote copy of the repo (the fork). I also learned how to verify if I sucessfully added the remote by using the command ``` git remote -v ```

Fortunately, the instructions were clear enough so there were not major issues.
